	ยง 4.3.11. Consume a name

    It returns a string containing the largest name that can be formed from
    adjacent code points in the stream, starting from the first.

    Note: This algorithm does not do the verification of the first few
    code points that are necessary to ensure the returned code points
    would constitute an <ident-token>. If that is the intended use,
    ensure that the stream starts with an identifier before calling
    this algorithm.
